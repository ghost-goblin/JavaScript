# JavaScript Fundamentals - [Part 2](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/fundamentals-part-2) 

## 1. What are the eight data types of javascript?
1. `number` for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1).
2. `bigint` is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
3. `string` for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
4. `boolean` for true/false.
5. `null` for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
6. `undefined` for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
7. `object` for more complex data structures.
8. `symbol` for unique identifiers.

## 2. Which data type is NOT primitive?
Data types that are known as primitive values in JavaScript are numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined. Objects such as functions and arrays are referred to as non-primitive values. The fundamental difference between primitives and non-primitives is that primitives are immutable and non-primitives are mutable.
Primitives are known as being immutable data types because there is no way to change a primitive value once it gets created.

3. What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes for strings?
4. Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions into a string?
5. How do you embed variables/expressions into a string?
6. How do you escape characters in a string?

9. What are the three logical operators and what do they stand for?
10. What are the comparison operators?
11. What is nesting?
12. What are truthy and falsy values?
13. What are the falsy values in JavaScript?
14. What is the syntax for an if/else conditional?
15. What is the syntax for a switch statement?
16. What is the syntax for a ternary operator?
17. What is the relationship between null and undefined?
18. What are conditionals?
