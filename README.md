ðŸŽ¯ My personal repository detailing the fundamentals of JavaScript

Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹ <br />
I am current going throught the JS fundamentals section at the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/fundamentals-part-1) and thought it might be useful to document my learning. I will go through all the questions and document what I can.

## Learning Outcomes
1. How do you declare a variable?
- `var`
- `let`
