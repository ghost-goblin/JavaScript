🎯 My personal repository detailing the fundamentals of JavaScript

Hi everyone 👋 <br />
I am current going throught the JS fundamentals section at the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/fundamentals-part-1) and thought it might be useful to document my learning.

## Learning Outcomes

1. How do you declare a variable? A _variable_ is a storage container for data.
```js
let message;

let message = 'Hello';
```
