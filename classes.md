# JavaScript - [Classes](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/classes)

Often, we need to create many objects of the same kind i.e. users. The syntax for a class is as follows:
```js
class MyClass {
  // class methods
  constructor() { ... }
  method1() { ... }
  method2() { ... }
  method3() { ... }
  ...
}
```
We can the use `use new MyClass()` to create a new object with all the listed methods.
