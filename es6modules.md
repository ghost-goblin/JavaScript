## Explain what npm is and where it was commonly used before being adopted on the frontend
The `node package manager` is a command line tool that gives you access to a gigantic repository of plugins, libraries and tools.
The `package.json` makes it easier for others to manage and install. Packages published to the registry must contain a `package.json` file.
A `package.json` file:
1. lists the packages your project depends on
2. specifies versions of a package that your project can use using semantic versioning rules
3. makes your build reproducible, and therefore easier to share with other developers
A `package.json` file must contain `name` and `version` fields.
